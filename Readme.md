About

This program fixes FFXIV refreshing the screen resolution when switching into the game window in a multi-monitor environment.

Usage
=====

1. Extract the exe and the dll to a folder.
2. Launch FFXIV client.
3. Run ffxiv-fixfullscreen.exe

Note: This only works with FFXIV DX11. The DX9 version of the game client doesn't seem to have this problem
